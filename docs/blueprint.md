- Accent color: Electric blue (#43B1F0) for highlighting interactive elements, drawing attention to CTAs, and reinforcing a modern look.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif, should be used for headlines to provide a futuristic and tech-oriented feel. 'Inter' is for body text.
- Use space-themed icons in a clean, outlined style. Preferably in blue or white, so that they are visible against the background.
- Use a clean, single-page layout to reduce clutter and focus attention.
- Subtle animations for page transitions and loading states. For instance, stars twinkling in the background.
